I was born in 1971 in Kyiv, Ukraine, and live all my life here. Programming since 1983 – starting with a programmable calculator, then БК-0010 (a Soviet PDP-11 clone) in Focal, Assembler and machine codes, then ZX Spectrum in Basic and Assembler, then IBM PC, DOS and Windows line. Worked as software developer since 1990. C, Assembler, Clipper, Delphi, Visual Basic, VB.Net and C#, not counting minor sidequests such as Visual FoxPro and Python. Mostly focused on backend, with basic HTML & Javascript knowledge. Grew from self-taught Junior level (although in those times it wasn't called a Junior yet) to Senior, Project Manager and Business Analyst.

Around 2009 I've noticed that my sharpness is starting to decline, I've burned out, went to a psychotherapy, got interested and in 2011 started to change my profession. In 2018 I've completely moved from software development to psychotherapy (namely, gestalt therapy).

But there are no former software developers :) In 2021 I've returned to coding as a hobby, decided to learn Kotlin and create some small games for desktop and Android.
